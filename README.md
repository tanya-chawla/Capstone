# Applied Data Science Capstone

## Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

## 1) Introduction/Business Problem

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to 
solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of 
stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about 
your problem.

**_The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location 
by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on 
the same regions._**

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data

Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use 
the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in 
combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, 
with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

**_To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be combining Toronto's 2016 Census that contains Population, 
Average income per Neighborhood with Toronot's Neighborhoods shapefile and Foursquare API to collect competitors on the 
same neighborhoods._**
